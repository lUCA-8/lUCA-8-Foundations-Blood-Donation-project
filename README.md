# lUCA-8-Foundations-Blood-Donation-project
# About Product
My project main idea to connect people who needs blood with the people wo wants to donate with there blood, trying to eliminate the exploitation of the black market, by creating a direct connection between the recipient and the donor and without any personal information.
The idea is to allow people who needs blood to publish a request just with the hospital name, the amount and blood type which needed then the system will create a unique code for this case, the recipient will need to give the hospital this code and everyone who wants to donate to him will get the same code and make his donation for that code.

# Mission
Connect the Donor with the Recipient without a direct contact or sharing information.


# Vision
Eliminate the exploitation of the Blood donation black market.
